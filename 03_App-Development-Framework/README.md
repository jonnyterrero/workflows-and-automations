## 🎯 Overview

This framework contains comprehensive documentation, guides, and best practices for building modern web and mobile applications. Whether you're building a simple web app or a complex full-stack solution, this framework provides everything you need to go from idea to production deployment.

**Perfect for engineers who need to:**
- Build user-facing applications for engineering tools
- Create commercial products from engineering solutions
- Develop web and mobile interfaces for biomedical/mechanical engineering projects
- Integrate engineering calculations with modern application interfaces
- Deploy scalable, production-ready applications

**How This Fits with Other Tech Stacks:**
- Use with **[Comprehensive Tech Stack](../01_Comprehensive_TechStack/)** for advanced simulations and CAD modeling
- Use with **[Optimized Tech Stack](../02_Optimized_TechStack/)** for backend API development and data processing
- This framework provides the frontend and deployment layer for engineering applications

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **Web**: Next.js 14+, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- **Mobile**: Flutter, Dart, Material Design
- **State Management**: React Context API, Zustand, Provider/Riverpod

### Backend
